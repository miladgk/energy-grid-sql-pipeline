-- Find the top 3 highest-value readings per sensor for the most
-- recent month of data (December 2023).
--
-- Techniques: CROSS JOIN LATERAL (per-row correlated subquery with LIMIT)
--
-- Why LATERAL is needed:
-- A standard JOIN cannot reference columns from the outer table (`se.sensor_id`)
-- inside a derived table subquery (`SELECT ... LIMIT 3`). While this could
-- theoretically be written using window functions (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)`)
-- followed by an outer filtering step (`WHERE rn <= 3`), that approach forces
-- PostgreSQL to materialize and sort the entire dataset across all sensors
-- before filtering.
--
-- `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` allows the subquery to act as a correlated for-each loop
-- over `sensors se`, executing the indexed Top-N lookup (`LIMIT 3`) directly
-- per sensor row. This avoids a full scan/sort and is vastly more efficient
-- when retrieving top-N rows per category.
